# PUB Robot Game: An AI Search Algorithm Showcase

This project demonstrates the implementation of AI search algorithms within a graphical user interface (GUI) to navigate a robot through various rooms. It is designed for academic purposes to illustrate the concepts of search algorithms in Artificial Intelligence.

# Project Overview

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide a visual and interactive demonstration of AI search algorithms. By navigating a robot through different rooms, we aim to showcase how search algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* can be applied to solve navigation problems.

Features
Interactive GUI: Built using Python's Tkinter library.
Room Navigation: Robot moves between rooms based on user-defined start and goal rooms.
Search Algorithms: Implementation of BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms for pathfinding.
Visualization: Visual representation of rooms, robot movements, and pathfinding process.
Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Tkinter library (included with Python)
robot.png image file for the robot's visual representation
Installation

Clone the repository:
bash
Kodu kopyala
git clone https://github.com/berdn70s/PUB_AI.git
Ensure the robot.png file is in the same directory as the se420_pubgame.py script.
Usage

Run the Python script to start the game:

python se420_pubgame.py
Gameplay Instructions
Enter the start and goal rooms using the input fields provided in the GUI.
Select the search algorithm to be used for navigation (BFS, DFS, A*).
The robot will navigate from the start room to the goal room, showcasing the selected search algorithm.
The path taken and the number of expanded nodes will be displayed.
File Structure

se420_pubgame.py: Main script for the PUB Robot Game.
robot.png: Image file for the robot's visual representation.
Academic Relevance

# This project serves as a practical example of implementing and visualizing search algorithms in AI. It provides insights into:

Search Strategies: Understanding the differences and use-cases of BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms.
Pathfinding Problems: Applying search algorithms to navigate through a grid of rooms.
AI in Games: Demonstrating how AI techniques can be used in game development and interactive applications.
